# Introduction to HTTP

## What is HTTP?

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of web communication. It defines how clients and servers can exchange data over a network
using text-based messages known as requests and responses.

### Key Characteristics of HTTP

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: In an HTTP server-client model, clients send HTTP requests to a server, which processes them and sends back HTTP
   responses.
2. **Statelessness**: Each request is processed independently without maintaining any state across requests.
3. **Versatility**: HTTP supports various methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., allowing for different types of operations (e.g., reading data,
   creating resources, updating data, deleting resources).
4. **Versioning**: Supports multiple versions, including HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/2, with HTTP/2 offering improved performance and efficiency.

### Examples of HTTP Methods

- **GET**: Used to retrieve data from a server.

  ```http
  GET /resource HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  ```

- **POST**: Used to create new resources on the server.

  ```http
  POST /resource HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
  ```

- **PUT**: Used to update existing resources on the server.

  ```http
  PUT /resource HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Jane Doe"
  }
  ```

- **DELETE**: Used to delete resources from the server.
  ```http
  DELETE /resource HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  ```

### Introduction to REST

**REST** is an architectural style that builds upon HTTP and emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and flexibility. It provides a standardized way for
building web applications by defining how resources are identified, manipulated, and accessed.

#### Key Principles of REST

1. **Statelessness**: Each request contains all necessary information for processing.
2. **Uniform Interface**:
   - Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
   - HTTP methods define operations on resources (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - Responses have a consistent structure and status codes.
3. **Cacheability**: Responses can be stored by clients to reduce load on servers.

#### RESTful Principles

- **Statelessness**: Each request contains all necessary information for processing.
- **Uniform Interface**:
  - Resources are identified using URIs.
  - HTTP methods define operations on resources (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Responses have a consistent structure and status codes.
- **Cacheability**: Responses can be stored by clients to reduce load on servers.

#### Example of a RESTful API

```http
GET /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

This request retrieves the user with ID 1, while:

```http
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

creates a new user.

### URL vs URI

- **URL**: A complete and absolute reference to a resource on the internet. It includes the protocol, hostname, port, path, query parameters, and
  fragment identifier.

  - Example: `http://example.com/users/1?filter=active#section`

- **URI**: An identification of a resource. It can be part of a URL or stand alone as an identifier. URIs are used to locate resources within the
  context of a particular protocol, such as HTTP.
  - Example: `/users/1` or `http://example.com/users/1`

### Status Codes

HTTP status codes provide information about the success or failure of an HTTP request, ranging from 200 (OK) to 500 (Internal Server Error).

- **2xx Success**: Indicates that the request was successful.

  - **200 OK**: The server successfully returned the requested resource.
  - **201 Created**: A new resource has been created on the server.

- **4xx Client Errors**: Indicate issues with the client's request.

  - **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

- **5xx Server Errors**: Indicate issues with the server's response.
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server while processing the request.

| Status Code                                        | Name                          | Description                                                                                                     |

| completes.                                         |

| 505                                                | HTTP Version Not Supported    | Indicates that the server does not support the requested HTTP version in the request message.                   |
|                                                    |

This table provides a comprehensive overview of all HTTP status codes, helping developers understand what each code means and when to expect it.

### Conclusion

HTTP is the backbone of web communication, and understanding URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) is essential for
building and interacting with web applications. By breaking down these concepts, developers can better design and implement robust RESTful services.
